# git-summary
Checks what repos has been changed in your workspace.

# Usage
* cd into a directory where you have multiple git repos you wanna check. For example: `cd Workspace`
* `git summary` (Checks the remotes to see if they have changes you do not or vica versa)
* `git summary -l` (Only checks for local changes and thus is much faster)
